In this project we predict the price of facebook stock for a specific day.<br>
Entire project implement through support vector regressor. However we implement three<br>

kernel, rbf kernel.<br>
Apart from that we use numpy and pandas for data processing and sklearn for model implementation<br>
and matplotlib for data visualization.
